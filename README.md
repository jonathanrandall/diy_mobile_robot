## Steps to build robot base and frame

__Step 1: Build the frame:__

<ins>parts list</ins>
* 2 X 432mm 1120 Series U-Channel (SKU: 1120-0017-0432)
* 2 X 528mm 1120 Series U-Chaneel (SKU: 1120-0021-0528)
* 4 X 1201 Series Quadblock pattern mount (SKU: 1201-0043-0002)
* 16 X 11mm M4 screws
* 16 X 8mm M4 screws
* 4 X flanged ball bearing, 8mm REX ID x 14mm OD, 5mm thickness (SKU: 1611-0514-4008). Note ID is inner diameter and OD is outer diameter.
* 4 X 1320 Series hyper hub, 8mm REX Bore (SKU: 1310-0016-4008)
* 5204 Series Yellow  Jacket Planetary Gear Motor, 80mm Lenght 8mm REX shart, 117 RPM (SKU: 5204-8002-0051). Note, this is the long shaft motor. If you use the shorter shaft, you will need a coupler and a shaft to attach to the wheel. This can be quite fiddly and adds to the cost. Also I'm using the 117 RPM motor, which is not fast but has good torque. My aim is to handle a payload of up to 50kg on a 30 degree incline. According to my calculations, this should handle that quite well, but might struggle witht he 223 RMP version.

1. Attach the quadblocks to the end of the shorter U-channels (432mm) with the 11mm screws. Mounting the quadblocks on the shorter channels will result in the base being a square. Each channel is 48mm wide, so the base will be (432 +48 +48) = 528mm. Note, you can use different sized U-Channels, depending on what you need. I've chosen theses sizes to bring it into line with the Stanford Mobile Aloha robot. This build is on the wider end of what I would normally do.
2. Attach the two 432mm at right angles with the 528mm channels, using the 8mm screws to connect, to make a square shape (see picture).
3. Attach the motors to the side of the frame. You can 10mm to 12mm screws for this. I've attached mine to the fourth hole down. There are lots of diagrams on the gobilda page for attaching the motors to channel. (it doesn't matter if you attach them to the long channel or the shorter channel since it is a square). 
4. Place the bearing,spacer and hyperhub on the end of the motor shaft and push down so that everything is nice and snug. Tighten the pinch screws on the hyperhub. Don't place the wheels on yet. They will get in the way.
