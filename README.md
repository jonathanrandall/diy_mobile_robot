## Steps to build robot base and frame

__Step 1: Build the frame:__

<ins>parts list</ins>
* 2 X 432mm 1120 Series U-Channel (SKU: 1120-0017-0432)
* 2 X 528mm 1120 Series U-Chaneel (SKU: 1120-0021-0528)
* 4 X 1201 Series Quadblock pattern mount (SKU: 1201-0043-0002)
* 16 X 11mm M4 screws
* 16 X 8mm M4 screws

1. Attach the quadblocks to the end of the shorter U-channels (432mm) with the 11mm screws. Mounting the quadblocks on the shorter channels will result in the base being a square. Each channel is 48mm wide, so the base will be (432 +48 +48) = 528mm. Note, you can use different sized U-Channels, depending on what you need. I've chosen theses sizes to bring it into line with the Stanford Mobile Aloha robot. This build is on the wider end of what I would normally do.
2. Attach the two 432mm at right angles with the 528mm channels, using the 8mm screws to connect, to make a square shape (see picture).
3. Attach the motors to the side of the frame. You can 10mm to 12mm screws for this. I've attached mine to the fourth hole down. There are lots of diagrams on the gobilda page for attaching the motors to channel. (it doesn't matter if you attach them to the long channel or the shorter channel since it is a square)
