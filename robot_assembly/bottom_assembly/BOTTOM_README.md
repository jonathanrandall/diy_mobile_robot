# Bottom of robot
The bottom layer of the robot contains the motor controllers, the esp32 a buck converter set to 12V and a buck converter set to 5V

## Parts list:
1. Cytron MD10C R3 motor controllers X 4. Or you can 2 X dual cytron dual motor drivers. I would recommend cytron if you want to use my code an wiring.
2. PCB or bread board. I printed up a PCB. The gerber files and fritzing files should be attached to this repo. I got this done at ![PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/).
3. ESP32: I'm using the 38 pin waveshare esp32. This has a thinner form factor than the ones you get off Amazon. My PCB design should also fit the fatter 38 pin esp32. I got it here ![https://www.waveshare.com/nodemcu-32s.htm](https://www.waveshare.com/nodemcu-32s.htm)
4. Nylong stand offs. I would get two packs of these.
5. 6S lipo battery or 2 X 3S lipo batteries. I used two 3S lip batteries in series.
6. Battery mount. I 3D printed mine. But you can make one out of lego, since the grid plates on the gobilda system line up with the lego grids, it is easy to drill holes to attach.
7. Four pin JST XH connectors. These are for the motor encoders. I used these from GoBilda. But you can use any you like. ![SKU: 3802-0910-0300](https://www.gobilda.com/encoder-cable-extension-4-pos-jst-xh-300mm-length/)
8. Bullet extenders (female) to connect the motor to the motor encoders. I used these from GoBilda. ![SKU:3800-0013-0300](https://www.gobilda.com/3-5mm-bullet-lead-mh-fc-300mm-length/)

## Steps to assemble bottom of robot

__Bottom of the robot__<br/>
![labeled bottom](https://github.com/jonathanrandall/diy_mobile_robot/blob/main/project_photos/IMG_0062_labeled.JPEG) <br/>
The bottom of the robot contains motor controllers, motors, batteries, esp32, 5V & 12V regulators and terminal strips for power wires.

1. Screw on the PCB and the motor controllers. I've screwed my motor controllers on diagonally because that was the only way I could get the standoffs to line up with the holes. Only the two diagonal standoffs are attached to the gridplate <br/>
