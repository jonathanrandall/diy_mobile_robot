## Steps to build robot base and frame
__Screw Drivers and Hex Keys__<br/>

The M4 socket head screws require a 3mm drive size. It is recommended to get the __Wera Tools 3mm Ball-End Hex-Plus L-Key__ (SKU: 5027104001). This will make building much easier, since it can access screws in awkward places. The drivers I used are pictured below.

__Step 1: Build the base of the frame:__<br/>
Note: robot upside down in picutre, so base is at the top. <br/>

<ins>parts list for base</ins>
* 2 X 432mm 1120 Series U-Channel (SKU: 1120-0017-0432)
* 2 X 528mm 1120 Series U-Chaneel (SKU: 1120-0021-0528)
* 4 X 1201 Series Quadblock pattern mount (SKU: 1201-0043-0002)
* 16 X 11mm M4 screws
* 16 X 8mm M4 screws
* 16 X 12mm M4 screws
* 4 X flanged ball bearing, 8mm REX ID x 14mm OD, 5mm thickness (SKU: 1611-0514-4008). Note ID is inner diameter and OD is outer diameter.
* 4 X 1320 Series hyper hub, 8mm REX Bore (SKU: 1310-0016-4008)
* 4 X Threaded Steel L-Bracket, 3 hole (SKU: 1147-0001-0003). Note there are four in each pack, so once pack.
* 1 X 1116 Series Grid Plate, 29 x 53 Hole, 232 x 424mm (SKU: 1116-0232-0424)
* 24 X 6mm screws (can also use 8mm if you run out, but 6mm is preferred).
* 5204 Series Yellow  Jacket Planetary Gear Motor, 80mm Lenght 8mm REX shart, 117 RPM (SKU: 5204-8002-0051). Note, this is the long shaft motor. If you use the shorter shaft, you will need a coupler and a shaft to attach to the wheel. This can be quite fiddly and adds to the cost. Also I'm using the 117 RPM motor, which is not fast but has good torque. My aim is to handle a payload of up to 50kg on a 30 degree incline. According to my calculations, this should handle that quite well, but might struggle witht he 223 RMP version.
* 4 X 1109 Series goRail, 624mm lenghth (SKU: 1109-0024-0624). 

<ins>Assembly of base</ins>
1. Attach the quadblocks to the end of the shorter U-channels (432mm) with the 11mm screws. Mounting the quadblocks on the shorter channels will result in the base being a square. Each channel is 48mm wide, so the base will be (432 +48 +48) = 528mm. Note, you can use different sized U-Channels, depending on what you need. I've chosen theses sizes to bring it into line with the Stanford Mobile Aloha robot. This build is on the wider end of what I would normally do.<br/>

2. Attach the two 432mm at right angles with the 528mm channels, using the 8mm screws to connect, to make a square shape (see picture).<br/>
![channels and motor](https://github.com/jonathanrandall/diy_mobile_robot/blob/main/robot_assembly/frame_motor_assembly/frame_assembly_photos/IMG_9023.JPEG)
3. Attach the motors to the side of the frame. You can 10mm to 12mm screws for this. I've attached mine to the fourth hole down. There are lots of diagrams on the gobilda page for attaching the motors to channel. Make sure the motor's power wires and encoder plug are facing upwards, so they are easy to access from the top. <br/>

4. Place the bearing,spacer and hyperhub on the end of the motor shaft and push down so that everything is nice and snug. Tighten the pinch screws on the hyperhub. Don't place the wheels on yet. They will get in the way.<br/>

5. Attach the goRail to the corners of the base with the 12mm M4 screws (or 10mm is ok as well), so they are standing verticle. They have threaded holes, which will line up with the holes on the U-Channel. When you attach a goRail, do not tighten the screws until all four have been placed, otherwise you risk cross-threading. I'm using 624mm goRail. You can use up to 1200mm. You can adjust the height of the goRail without changing anything else. If you adjust the dimensions of the U-Channel, the grid plates will also need to be adjusted.<br/>

6. Attach the L-Brackets, with the 6mm M4 screws, to each of the U-Channels that the motors are on. They should be attached off centre becasue this is where you are going to mount the grid plate.<br/>

7. Mount the grid plate on the L-Brackets with the 6mm M4 screws.<br/>

__Step 2: Build the top of the frame:__

<ins>parts list</ins>
* 2 X 528mm 1120 Series U-Chaneel (SKU: 1120-0021-0528)
* 2 X 1116 Series Grid Plate, 29 x 53 Hole, 232 x 424mm (SKU: 1116-0232-0424)
* 8 X Threaded Steel L-Bracket, 3 hole (SKU: 1147-0001-0003). Note there are four in each pack, so two packs.
* 48 X 6mm M4 screws (can also use 8mm if you run out, but 6mm is preferred).

<ins>Assembly of top of the frame</ins>
1. Attach the 4 L-Brackets to the edge of each of the U-Channels, so that the U-Channel is like an upside down U, and the bracket is flush with the top (see picture). Makes sure the L-Brackets are spaced, so that you can attach the grid plates. Don't put any in the middle of the channel.
2. Once you have all L-brackets attached line up the two U-channels with the brackets facing each other and put the grid plates on, so that the two U-Channels are held together with the grid plates. Make sure the grid plates are attached along the short edge (see pictures). So the long edge is connecting the two U-Channels. Everything is measured out so it fits perfectly on the top of the robot.<br/>

__Step 3: Attach the top of the frame:__

<ins>parts list</ins>
* 16 X 12mm M4 screws. Can use anywhere from 10mm to 12mm for this step, depedending on what you have. I mixed it up a bit because I was running out of 12mm screws.

<ins>Finish assembly</ins?
1. Line up the threaded holes in the GoRail with the holes in the corner of the top of the frame.
2. Fix on with the chosen screws.<br/>

__Step 4: Attach the wheels:__

Put the wheels on last, otherwise they get in the way when you're trying to screw on the other stuff.

<ins>parts list</ins>
* Four wheels. I'm using the Wasteland Wheel, 144mm Diameter, 52mm Width (SKU: 3616-0014-0144)
* 16 X 11mm M4 screws (can also use 10mm).
* 4 X washers

<ins>Assembly of wheels</ins>
1. Screw onto hyperhubs with 11mm screws and washers.<br/>
